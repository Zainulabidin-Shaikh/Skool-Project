"Why I Decided to Focus on Python DevelopmentFor much of my life, I’ve been a jack of all trades—working in many areas without committing to one. This scattered approach led to stagnation. I felt like I was making progress, but it was slow, and I didn’t have much to show for it. After months of being unfocused—juggling a recipe finder app in Flutter, multiple Django web apps, school, and attempts to start a business—I realized I wasn’t getting anywhere meaningful. The turning point came when I made a decision to focus on just one thing: Python. The Power of Focus The hardest part of focusing was saying “no” to other opportunities. Everything felt promising, but I realized none of them would lead anywhere if I didn’t fully commit to one. By focusing on Python, I gained clarity and started building momentum. Progress became tangible. Why Python? Python’s versatility makes it ideal for a range of projects—from web apps to automation scripts. It’s beginner-friendly, and I love teaching it, which allows me to help others. As the first programming language I learned, Python holds a special place for me. While focusing on something more niche might be better for some, Python allows me to explore various areas while mastering the language. Its simplicity aligns with my values when creating things. Lessons Learned - Focus isn’t just about saying “no”; it’s about consistently building something meaningful, whether it’s a portfolio, a product, or a following. - Start small, but aim big. Choose something you enjoy and can commit to. - Progress compounds when you build momentum and keep scaling your efforts. Advice for Fellow Developers - Pick a niche: Decide what excites you—web apps, data science, or automation. - Choose if you want to focus on jobs or business? Jobs are often simpler to start, while businesses require broader skills. - Build a foundation: Whether it’s a portfolio or social media presence, focus on things you can grow over time. - Keep scaling: Start with small projects and progressively take on bigger challenges.",1

"🚀 Project Update 🚀As the Project Lead, this journey has been challenging , requiring me to manage multiple responsibilities, including code reviews, team coordination, and ensuring smooth communication among all team members. We recently wrapped up the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, where we uncovered valuable insights and patterns in our dataset. Through this phase, I shared the following key takeaways with my team: 1. Understand the dataset first - Letting my team know the importance of understanding the dataset first, it's crucial to read dataset descriptions and fully comprehend the features to avoid misinterpretation. 2. Avoid Label Encoding before Train-Test Split – Applying label encoding too early may introduce data leakage, which can distort model performance. 3. Use appropriate encoding for ranked data – If a dataset has an inherent ranking (ordinal data), methods like dictionary mapping or ordinal encoding are more suitable than standard label encoding. 4. Watch out for multicollinearity – Some features were highly correlated, so we carefully examined them to prevent redundancy and improve model interpretability. It was an exciting and insightful phase, as my team members delivered exceptional EDA techniques and deep data insights! This week, we are transitioning into the Model Training & Evaluation phase, which will span two weeks. We aim to build robust models, optimize hyperparameters, and assess performance using key metrics.",0

The clearer and more precise your questions, the better your outputs. 🚀 Remember: - Clarify your goal: What do you want to achieve with the prompt? - Be specific: Vague questions lead to vague answers. - Iterate: Don’t hesitate to adjust and refine your prompts based on the results. Great prompt engineering starts with understanding the task and breaking it down into meaningful, actionable questions. Ask the right questions, and you'll get the right answers.",1

"Looking for partnerI wanted to share an idea that I believe could be a fantastic opportunity for both of us to increase our earnings by working together. I’m Sekiya, a software engineer from Japan, and as you may know, I've noticed that many companies looking for full-time remote hires often prefer candidates from the US or EU, which typically allows for higher salaries. I have a skilled development team that can efficiently handle multiple projects, and I think we could create a win-win situation. Here’s my proposal: we collaborate on securing remote roles. You would manage the hiring process and client interactions (interviews, onboarding, etc.), while I would take care of the development work once we secure a position. We could split the earnings—40% for you and 60% for me—once the job is stable. The beauty of this collaboration is that it allows us to pursue multiple full-time positions simultaneously. Most individuals can only commit to one role due to time constraints, but by working together, we can effectively distribute tasks and ensure all responsibilities are met while maximizing our income. This approach lets us take full advantage of the remote work landscape. Long-term, if this partnership works well, we could even scale it into a full-fledged agency. We’d have the infrastructure in place—your expertise in client relations and my team’s technical execution—which means we could onboard more developers, take on bigger contracts, and build a sustainable business model. For now, though, this is a low-risk, high-reward way to test the waters and grow our income streams. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this! If you're open to it, we can discuss further and refine the approach. Looking forward to your response.",0

"Python Internals: Variables, References & Copying:In Python, everything is an object. When we assign a value to a variable, it doesn't store the data type — it holds a reference to an object in memory, which has the type and value. So when two variables point to the same object, changes via one will reflect in the other — because the underlying memory is shared. Shallow Copy creates a new outer object but keeps references to inner (nested) objects. Changes to nested items affect both copies. Deep Copy recursively clones everything — a full new object with independent nested values. Changes made to it won’t affect the original.",0

"PROJECT COMPLETEDAfter weeks of working on the project, i'm excited to announce the successful completion of our project: Diamond Price Predictor – The 4C Model! We developed a machine learning model that estimates diamond prices based on carat, cut, color, and clarity, plus additional attributes like depth and dimensions. From data wrangling to model deployment, this project was a full pipeline experience! 🚀 What we did: ✅ Performed EDA and feature engineering ✅ Trained and fine-tuned multiple regression models ✅ Evaluated with RMSE, MAE, and R² ✅ Built and deployed a real-time price prediction app using Streamlit 🎯 What I learned as the Project Lead: >> How to guide a team and keep everyone on track >>. How to make decisions and solve problems quickly >>. How to explain ideas clearly and work well with others >>. How to stay focused even when things didn’t go as planned >>. That learning and teamwork really matter in any project",1

"Python f-stringsf-strings in Python add a lot of what you can do with text. Regularly you have to convert different data types to strings before you can add them to a string. ------------------------------- age = 22 name = ""Max"" print(""hello "" + name + "" you are "" + str(age) + "" years old"") ------------------------------- This can be tedious and it isn't that powerful. f-strings help solve this, they allow you to format different variables and functions inside a string. (f stands for format). Here is the same example from before with an f string ------------------------------- age = 22 name = ""Max"" print(f""hello {name} you are {age} years old"") ------------------------------- This is a lot more readable. f-strings can execute any function. Anything that returns a value (variables just return whatever they're storing) a f-string can do. This allows you to do things like this easily as well: ------------------------------- age = 22 name = ""Max"" print(f""hello {name} you will be {age + 10} years old in 10 years"") ------------------------------- It goes even further than that though because f-strings have some extra functionality (show in images at the bottom)",0
"Simple Projects to do as you learnOne of the best ways to learn quicker is to do projects. Working on projects as you learn (and using them to guide what you learn) is a great way to progress because you: - build a portfolio - make sure you learn meaningful things - and get to practice I recommend working on projects in 90% of cases. The only time you shouldn't be working on some kind of project (even if its just in the background of your learning) is if you don't know enough yet to understand what projects to do or how they work. Here are some great project ideas for different fields that you can do as you learn (and improve as you learn more) that will also help build your portfolio: Data Science - Make a tool to visualize data in an organized nice way. - You can start with just printing dictionaries and list data structures to the terminal and over time improve it with charts and more in depth organization. - This shows that you know how to work with data on your portfolio and can be a great tool for you to use in your future work if you need to create charts easily. Web Development - Make a personal portfolio. - You can start with just python basic stuff as you learn it in the terminal, then learn flask or django to create a website with it. - Then after you finish that you have a hub that 1. shows you know how to make websites, and 2. you can put your future projects on. Automation - Automate project creation for python projects. - Again you can start simple here but over time as you add to it, this can be a tool you use to speed up your work in the future. So you are building an actual useful tool as you learn that works as a portfolio piece and will help you in the future. Web Scraping - For web scraping it's kind of hard to think of a tool that will help you, work as a portfolio piece, and help you learn. - You could make a scraper that pulls job data for jobs you might be interested though and it would fit all three criteria. Outside of that it depends more on what you are doing web scraping for.",0
"How to start doing data analysis in PythonOne major package for data science and data analysis in Python is pandas. To install it you simply run: pip install pandas This package gives you access to more data structures that allow you to easily work with data: such as DataFrame. I attached a picture of a DataFrame at the bottom. It also provides a lot of tools for reading, cleaning, transforming and analyzing data. Another common tool to use is Jupyter (or google Colab) when working with data. To install it just run: pip install jupyter Then to start a Jupyter environment in your browser run: jupyter lab This gives you access to a notebook environment where you can run cells independently (so you don't have to do large computations multiple times when making small changes). Some common pandas functions include: - pandas.DataFrame: where you can turn dictionaries into a DataFrame to work with. - pandas.read_csv(): where you can turn csv files into a DataFrame to work with. - df.head(): where you an see the first few elements of a DataFrame (df). - df.describe(): where you can see key stats about the DataFrame (count, mean, std, min...). - df\[key\]: where you can access a row or a column. - df\[df\[key\] > 0\]: where you can filter by values larger than a number. - Etc. Here is a link to their documentation that has some very good guides to some of the things you can do. If you guys want I can also work on more resources about this in posts or courses. https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html",0

"How LLMs WorkLLMs (large language models) are trained algorithms that receive text input and output a predicted humanlike text output. They work the same way autocomplete does at a larger scale. LLM can be broken down as such: - Large - meaning the size of the model (lots of data and parameters). - Language Model - meaning the type of machine learning algorithm (receive and output text). The goal of most machine learning models is to generalize for whatever task you are trying to accomplish. Since LLMs are focused on generating text (very general problem with a lot of applications), they are very general and preform very well at a lot of tasks. This generalization and performance comes at the cost of the size of these models and computational power (which also means cost). This is why better models cost more. These models predict the probability that a token (part of a word) follows the input to the model. This new predicted token is added to the original input, then that new string is input to the model for the next token and so on until the model either finishes or runs out of tokens it can output. Most LLMs use a transformer neural network. You can read a paper on them here for now if you're interested in learning more about them: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 There are a few different types of LLMs: - Pretrained Model - most base models have been trained on large amount of data to predict a missing token (either from inside a sentence or at the end generally). - Instruction-Tuned LLMs - These Pretrained Models are then often further tuned with instruction answer sets of problems. This includes Q&A pairs typically. This is why LLMs are able to take in a question and generate an answer instead of just working like autocomplete where they continue your sentence. - Dialogue-Tuned LLMs - These LLMs can be and usually are trained further with full dialogues of user questions, model answers, follow up question etc. This is where LLMs get the ability to use past questions and answers in their responses.",0

"Embrace the Python Journey: My Advice for New LearnersHi everyone, I hope you're all doing well and welcome to all the new members! 🌟 I’m excited that you're learning new things in this amazing AI era. One piece of advice I’d like to share if you're learning Python: try not to rely on AI for code generation at the start. While AI can be helpful later on, using it too early can hinder your learning journey. It might make you dependent on it, and when your project needs sudden changes, you could struggle because you won't have developed the skills to handle it on your own. Keep pushing yourself to solve problems and learn step-by-step. Don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you need any suggestions or advice on how to crack the Python journey!",0
"AI Agent With ToolsI've been working with agents a lot recently though langchain and langgraph, here is a quick project I did today where I gave Google Gemini's latest model access to a file creation tool and a tool to run shell commands.

"Update on my end-to-end project as a Project LeadAs we progress in our project, we have successfully completed the Model Training phase (without hyperparameter tuning). This phase was critical in laying a solid foundation for our models, and I shared some key insights with my team: 🔹 Prioritize Preprocessing – The quality of data preprocessing plays a crucial role in model performance. Ensuring proper handling of missing values, scaling, and encoding significantly impacts results. 🔹 Be Cautious with High Accuracy Scores – A high accuracy score isn’t always a good sign! It could indicate overfitting, making the model unreliable on unseen data. To detect overfitting, always validate your model using cross-validation, learning curve and more 🔹 RMSE Gap Matters – The smaller the gap between training RMSE and test RMSE, the better the model’s generalization. A large gap could mean the model is overfitting or underfitting. 🔹 Model Selection Strategy – Choosing a model should be based on both good generalization and accuracy while ensuring it does not overfit excessively. A well-balanced model will perform consistently across different datasets. This phase was both challenging and insightful, as the team demonstrated strong analytical skills and problem-solving abilities.",0

With the goal being to write a program to find unique words in a sentence and count them using a set, I: 1.) Created a dictionary to add the words too as well as handle the counting of the word 2.) Then I opened a set to add the tuples from the dictionary into the set 3.) I reversed the order of the key and val to val key to order from highest to lowest for word count 4.) Printed the list but reordered it by word and count Could I have handed this differntly?

"Don’t Just Code DRY — Think DRY!Important note: If you haven’t read the previous post, please do so now—and don’t come back to this one until you’ve given the brain teaser at least an hour to rewire your brain! RECAP: In that post, I asked you to count the pairs of different fingers on one hand. Hopefully, you arrived at 10 pairs. Then, I challenged you to determine the number of triples of different fingers, without counting. HERE'S THE SOLUTION: Imagine counting pairs of fingers by folding two fingers at a time. Each time we fold two fingers, three fingers remain unfolded. This means that counting a pair of fingers by folding them is equivalent to counting a triple of fingers by folding the remaining two! So, WITHOUT COUNTING, we immediately know that the number of triples is the same as the number of pairs—10. WHY DOES THIS MATTER FOR PROGRAMMING? What we just did is an example of reducing one problem to another — and that's how programmers think! This is exactly the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) mindset. Instead of reinventing the wheel, programmers define a minimal set of functions and then express every needed computation in terms of those functions. And if you want to take it a level higher, great programmers design functions that create an application-specific language, allowing them to think and code within it.

"Golden Nugget - Feb 20, 2025I really dug the way that casting was taught in Getting User Input. Previously I had written h = input('Enter Hours:\t') r = input('Rate per hour:\t') h = float(h) r = float(r) print(f'your pay will be {h * r}') But now I can see how it’s much nicer to write: h = float(input('Enter Hours:\t')) r = float(input('Rate per hour:\t')) print(f'Your pay will be {h * r}') It’s only 2 lines I’m saving by casting the input immediately, but over a career I think it will make a big difference and I’m glad to be learning this now.",0

"AI has changed everything!When I graduated, there was no ChatGPT, Gemini, or Grok—I spent hours debugging manually. Now, AI tools like DeepSeek make coding easier. But if you're just starting, don’t rely entirely on AI. Learn the fundamentals, use LLMs to enhance—not replace—your skills. Total dependence on AI will limit your growth and make change management tough. Use AI wisely, keep learning, and grow!",1

"This brain teaser will develop your programmer's mindset!If you're a beginner, grappling with this teaser will start rewiring your brain. That’s how it works—if you don’t wrestle with a problem, you don’t get the benefit. So, take this one for a walk in your mind and hopefully experience that satisfying “aha!” moment. Let’s begin. 👉 How many fingers do you have on one hand? Easy, right? 👉 Now, count the pairs of different fingers. Take your time. And now, the real challenge: 💡 How many triples of different fingers are there on your hand? But wait! This time, you must answer WITHOUT COUNTING.

Challenge Types & Rewards Challenges should have tiers, each with unique rewards: 📜 Standard Challenges - Give XP & basic items (e.g., ""Python Novice’s Ring"") - Needed for leveling up - Some repeatable, some one-time 🏆 One-Time Legendary Challenges - Special boss fights or difficult problems - Grant rare items, massive XP, and leaderboard recognition - Limited attempts (like a ""raid"" in an RPG) 🗝️ Unlockable Areas / Dungeons - Some parts of the game (advanced topics) are locked - To enter, you must level up or collect key items - Example: You need the ""Loops Master’s Staff"" to access recursion puzzles 🔹 3. Item System Players get gear & artifacts as rewards: Example Item Rewards: - ""Loop Master's Staff"" (Awarded for completing loop challenges) - ""OOP Wizard’s Cloak"" (For finishing an OOP milestone) - ""Debugger's Ring"" (For solving debugging problems) - ""Python Grandmaster Medal"" (Leaderboard top reward)",0

"Community Project - PLEASE VOTEThe first community project meeting was this morning, thank you to everyone who showed up, we introduced ourselves, then started to discuss the project that we would want to work on. We came up with 2 tangible ideas, but also want to explore other project ideas in different niches as well. Please vote on what project you would like to work on or see, we're going to try to decide on the project before next week so we can start working on planning and breaking it down next week. Here are the projects we discussed: 1. A LLM fine tuned with Python knowledge to work as a resource for developers This project suggested by @Noah Fry would be a LLM that we train with python data and projects to specialize it to basically be like a ChatGPT for Python specific. This would allow people in this community, other developers, and people who want to know more about python to ask specific questions and get more depth and resources in their answers from it. 2. A Online Game to help people learn Python This project suggested by @Patrick Edosoma would be a game that people have to solve problems and go through challenges to learn Python. @Cristian Macovei mentioned this website that is a great online resource to learn git https://learngitbranching.js.org as something similar so you can get an idea of what the project would entail.

"Generative Drum AI FixedI fixed my streamlit app, there was some issues with the pathing before. Here it is for those of you that did not see it before when I made a post about it: https://drumgenai.streamlit.app I made it along with @Noah Fry for a school project last semester. Whenever I get more into teaching AI content I will do a full breakdown, but for now this was the general process: The first thing we did was figure out a way to represent the data. Since drum patterns are sequential, we used midi (drum sequencing) to convert drum hits to binary (1 if a drum plays, 0 if it does not) on a specific note. This also removes the need for things such as temp and velocity. A drum pattern like this: Kick - - - Kick - - - Kick - - - Kick - - Kick - - - - Snare - - - - - - - Snare - - - - HH - HH - HH - HH - HH - HH - HH - HH -.... Can be encoded into: 1000100010001001 0000100000001000 1010101010101010 With each line being a separate list containing the track. We manually converted Wav drum breaks into midi files then wrote a script to convert those midi files into separate binary files for each track of each loop. We made about 200. We then took parts of some of the drum patterns. E.g. the kick from track one, snare from 3, HH from 5 at random and reviewed them to see if they sounded good or not. This was to create more data. We then had around 600 tracks. After this we trained machine learning models to generate the binary patterns for a LSTM model and a Transformer model. We did one other model that we were having some issues deploying the app with. After this we built the streamlit app and deployed it. You can see the code for the app here ""https://github.com/maxmeadowcroft/gen_ai_drum_generator"". Let me know if you have any specific questions. Again, I will go in depth on some of this whenever I get to making AI courses in the future.",0
"How the Python Developers Community Transformed My CareerHey everyone! When I first started learning Python, I was mainly focused on web development and API integrations. I had no idea that joining the Python Developers Community would take my journey to a whole new level. This community has been a game-changer for me. From open-source collaborations to late-night debugging sessions, the support and shared knowledge here have helped me tackle some real challenges—whether it was optimizing blockchain transactions, streamlining backend systems, or scaling large-scale applications. A huge shoutout to Maximus Meadowcroft, whose leadership has built an incredible space for developers to connect, learn, and grow. His guidance, along with the passion and generosity of this community, has made all the difference in my progress. Beyond just coding, being here has introduced me to a network of brilliant minds, always willing to help and inspire. I’m grateful to be part of such an amazing group and excited to keep contributing!

"Which tool would you use if it existed?Me and @Noah Fry are working on a project for a security class and want to build something that would be useful to Python Developers. We have came up with a few ideas that we think could be valuable. Please let us know if you would be interested in using either of these tools if we developed them or if you have any other security / ai related project ideas that you would like from us. I will also do my best to document and create content around our development process while we work on the projects to help you learn. Here are the breakdowns of the two projects and what the first versions of the projects would contain: ---------------------------------- 1 - Intelligent Dependency Checker for PyPI Packages OVERVIEW Monitors Python dependencies for malicious code, suspicious updates, or known CVEs, leveraging AI to spot unusual patterns. -- FIRST VERSION - Primary Goal: Provide a quick way for developers to see if the Python packages they’re using (or planning to use) have known security issues or suspicious characteristics. Core Features: - Vulnerability Database Integration: Checks each package against publicly available sources (e.g., PyPAAdvisory Database, Safety DB) to identify known CVEs or reported security flaws. - Metadata Analysis: Gathers basic data (release frequency, maintainer info, etc.) from PyPI to spot unusual patterns (e.g., package rename, rapid versioning). - Risk Score: Generates a simple 1–10 or low/medium/high “risk score” so developers can decide whether to proceed with installation or investigate further. ------------------------------------------ 2 - Secrets Detection & Remediation Tool OVERVIEW An AI-based scanner that looks for exposed API keys, credentials, tokens, and other secrets in Python repositories. -- FIRST VERSION - Primary Goal: Detect accidentally committed secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) in a Python codebase or repository and guide developers on how to fix the problem.",1
Contest Voting Fairness (IMPORTANT)Hello community members. The December/January contest voting is almost over. It has been brought to my attention some of the votes appear to be bots or accounts that have joined simply for the sake of voting. In order to ensure fairness let me know what you think would be a good way to count the votes despite this. Here are some of the ideas I have had. If you have any other ides let me know in the comments. I also am working on measures to ensure fair competitions in the future. Some of my ideas for future contests include live voting (where we all join a meeting and users showcase their projects then members vote from within the meeting). (Tiered voting so you can vote for multiple people with multiple point values).,1
"Competition winners 🏆Hello everyone, for the December 2024 contest I have decided to count the votes based on everyone's levels after the poll and some consideration.

Here are the results and the number of votes (each persons vote counts as whatever their community rank is). 🥇 - $100 - @Patrick Edosoma - Osteoporosis knee Classification (27 points) 🥈 - $25 - @Haider Aman - Knee Surgery Risk Calculator (18 points) 🥉 - $0.25 - @Dahiru Ibrahim - Knee GPT / U-Knee Versity (12 points) I am work to build a voting system that requires everyone to be active in the community (to a certain extent at least) so it's fair as well as figuring out ways to make all future competitions better. I will make a post later this week for the voting of the next competition category. Thank you all for participating if you made a project or just voted 😁. For the winners, please DM me about how I can send you your prize money.",0

"💻 Overcoming Challenges in AI Integration 💻@Patrick Edosoma It took me almost three days to successfully integrate AI agents into my code. The main hurdle I faced was Torch not being supported in my current Python version. This setback pushed me to explore new tools and solutions, leading me to discover the power of Conda virtual environments and Docker for managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility. As AI and Machine Learning demand large storage space and strong processing capabilities for data handling, this experience taught me how crucial it is to have the right setup for building scalable, high-performance AI solutions. Despite the challenges, it was an exciting learning journey, and I’m looking forward to applying these techniques and tools to more complex projects moving forward! 🚀",1

"Why Community Matters: Reflections on My Data Science PathWhen I was in university, I decided to learn C++ on my own. Out of curiosity, I asked a friend why he loved Python so much. Truth be told, I was initially intimidated by the name ""Python"" (it sounded scary!😁). His response, however, changed everything for me. He said Python was easy to learn and understand, extremely versatile, widely used, and most importantly, Python developers were in high demand. That last point about demand struck a chord with me. Without hesitation, I bought a course titled ""100 Days of Python"" and started learning. It was a lot of fun, and as I progressed, I decided to channel my newfound Python skills into data science—a field I’ve loved. Having studied Mathematics and Chemistry in my diploma program for four years, followed by another four years studying Mathematics in my undergraduate, my passion for statistics was undeniable. At first, I didn’t know how to pursue becoming a data scientist. So, I went on Udemy and purchased my first-ever course, ""Data Science 360."" It was tough; I barely understood anything at first. But I kept at it watching, rewatching, and practicing what the instructors were doing. Eventually, I completed the course, with only a basic understanding of what data science meant 😂😂😂. Determined to learn more, I purchased another course by Jose Portilla, and that decision transformed my journey. Jose’s teaching style was clear and engaging. He explained concepts like model intuition, coefficients, weights, and biases in a way that made everything click for me. My knowledge grew, and I started to truly understand data science. I kept buying his courses, one after another, and he became my invisible mentor. Many nights, I even fell asleep listening to his voice, and to this day, I dream of meeting him in person. However, I realized that self-paced learning wasn’t enough. I was learning but felt disconnected and unsure of my direction. That’s when I joined a bootcamp. It was a game-changer. In the bootcamp, I met like-minded individuals who shared the same goals. Together, we built projects, had live sessions, and supported each other. This collaborative environment deepened my love for data science.",1

"Daily Python 🐍 - DescriptorsDescriptors are a little more of an advanced features in Python, but understanding them helps you understand how a lot of other parts of Python work. A descriptor is basically a class that allows you to control how attributes of other classes work. You can control what happens when someone accesses an attribute, sets an attribute, or deletes an attribute. You can do this with these methods: - `__get__(self, instance, owner)`: Defines behavior for attribute access. - `__set__(self, instance, value)`: Defines behavior for attribute assignment. - `__delete__(self, instance)`: Defines behavior for attribute deletion. The image shows a example for how you can use them to make an attribute of a class read only. I have full posts exploring them at these links if you are interested: - Classroom - Blog - LinkedIn",0

The image below shows an example of a context manger. If you want to read more about how they work and see more examples, I have posted some articles again for this: - Classroom - Blog - LinkedIn",0

"Python tip of the day, some things you can do with f-strings. (Hint: they're really powerful).F-strings allow you to supercharge your python print statements and strings. There are a lot of really cool things you can do with them. —————— Debug mode You can format printing out what a variable contains to look really nice. (See the first picture). —————— Multiline f-strings You can use triple quotation marks to make a multiline f-sting to help you format even better. (Picture 2). —————— Number Formatting You can also change the types of numbers or round the decimals of them with f-strings. (Picture 3). —————— Percentages Similarly if you have a percent that is not yet formatted you can format it like this. (Picture 4). —————— Commas as a thousands separator You can format big numbers by putting commas between the sections to make them easier to read. (Picture 5). —————— Alignment and padding You can pad your output with a character, then align what you want to output inside of it. (Picture 6). —————— Date Formatting If you use DateTime, you can format how you print out the information. (Picture 7).",1

"Python’s Popularity in AI and Data SciencePython continues to dominate fields like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data science due to its simplicity and a rich ecosystem of libraries. Tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn make it easier than ever to build complex models, while Pandas and NumPy simplify data manipulation and analysis. Python’s versatility also extends to deployment, with frameworks like Flask and FastAPI enabling seamless integration of AI models into web applications. Combined with cloud services like AWS and Google Cloud, developers can scale AI solutions effectively. To make the most of Python’s strengths: - Explore libraries like PyTorch for deep learning and Pandas for data analysis. - Use FastAPI for building lightweight APIs to deploy machine learning models. Python's appeal lies in its balance of accessibility and power. It’s amazing how a language that’s so beginner-friendly can also drive cutting-edge innovations in AI and data science. Its thriving community ensures that it will remain a cornerstone of tech for years to come.",1
