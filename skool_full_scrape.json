    "post_content_snippet": "For much of my life, I‚Äôve been a jack of all trades‚Äîworking in many areas without committing to one. This scattered approach led to stagnation. I felt like I was making progress, but it was slow, and I didn‚Äôt have much to show for it. After months of being unfocused‚Äîjuggling a recipe finder app in Flutter, multiple Django web apps, school, and attempts to start a business‚ÄîI realized I wasn‚Äôt getting anywhere meaningful. The turning point came when I made a decision to focus on just one thing: Python. The Power of Focus The hardest part of focusing was saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to other opportunities. Everything felt promising, but I realized none of them would lead anywhere if I didn‚Äôt fully commit to one. By focusing on Python, I gained clarity and started building momentum. Progress became tangible. Why Python? Python‚Äôs versatility makes it ideal for a range of projects‚Äîfrom web apps to automation scripts. It‚Äôs beginner-friendly, and I love teaching it, which allows me to help others. As the first programming language I learned, Python holds a special place for me. While focusing on something more niche might be better for some, Python allows me to explore various areas while mastering the language. Its simplicity aligns with my values when creating things. Lessons Learned - Focus isn‚Äôt just about saying ‚Äúno‚Äù; it‚Äôs about consistently building something meaningful, whether it‚Äôs a portfolio, a product, or a following. - Start small, but aim big. Choose something you enjoy and can commit to. - Progress compounds when you build momentum and keep scaling your efforts. Advice for Fellow Developers - Pick a niche: Decide what excites you‚Äîweb apps, data science, or automation. - Choose if you want to focus on jobs or business? Jobs are often simpler to start, while businesses require broader skills. - Build a foundation: Whether it‚Äôs a portfolio or social media presence, focus on things you can grow over time. - Keep scaling: Start with small projects and progressively take on bigger challenges.",

    "post_content_snippet": "As the Project Lead, this journey has been challenging , requiring me to manage multiple responsibilities, including code reviews, team coordination, and ensuring smooth communication among all team members. We recently wrapped up the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, where we uncovered valuable insights and patterns in our dataset. Through this phase, I shared the following key takeaways with my team: 1. Understand the dataset first - Letting my team know the importance of understanding the dataset first, it's crucial to read dataset descriptions and fully comprehend the features to avoid misinterpretation. 2. Avoid Label Encoding before Train-Test Split ‚Äì Applying label encoding too early may introduce data leakage, which can distort model performance. 3. Use appropriate encoding for ranked data ‚Äì If a dataset has an inherent ranking (ordinal data), methods like dictionary mapping or ordinal encoding are more suitable than standard label encoding. 4. Watch out for multicollinearity ‚Äì Some features were highly correlated, so we carefully examined them to prevent redundancy and improve model interpretability. It was an exciting and insightful phase, as my team members delivered exceptional EDA techniques and deep data insights! This week, we are transitioning into the Model Training & Evaluation phase, which will span two weeks. We aim to build robust models, optimize hyperparameters, and assess performance using key metrics.",

    "post_content_snippet": "I wanted to share an idea that I believe could be a fantastic opportunity for both of us to increase our earnings by working together. I‚Äôm Sekiya, a software engineer from Japan, and as you may know, I've noticed that many companies looking for full-time remote hires often prefer candidates from the US or EU, which typically allows for higher salaries. I have a skilled development team that can efficiently handle multiple projects, and I think we could create a win-win situation. Here‚Äôs my proposal: we collaborate on securing remote roles. You would manage the hiring process and client interactions (interviews, onboarding, etc.), while I would take care of the development work once we secure a position. We could split the earnings‚Äî40% for you and 60% for me‚Äîonce the job is stable. The beauty of this collaboration is that it allows us to pursue multiple full-time positions simultaneously. Most individuals can only commit to one role due to time constraints, but by working together, we can effectively distribute tasks and ensure all responsibilities are met while maximizing our income. This approach lets us take full advantage of the remote work landscape. Long-term, if this partnership works well, we could even scale it into a full-fledged agency. We‚Äôd have the infrastructure in place‚Äîyour expertise in client relations and my team‚Äôs technical execution‚Äîwhich means we could onboard more developers, take on bigger contracts, and build a sustainable business model. For now, though, this is a low-risk, high-reward way to test the waters and grow our income streams. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on this! If you're open to it, we can discuss further and refine the approach. Looking forward to your response.",

When we assign a value to a variable, it doesn't store the data type ‚Äî it holds a reference to an object in memory, which has the type and value. So when two variables point to the same object, changes via one will reflect in the other ‚Äî because the underlying memory is shared. Shallow Copy creates a new outer object but keeps references to inner (nested) objects. Changes to nested items affect both copies. Deep Copy recursively clones everything ‚Äî a full new object with independent nested values. Changes made to it won‚Äôt affect the original.",

Regularly you have to convert different data types to strings before you can add them to a string. ------------------------------- age = 22 name = \"Max\" print(\"hello \" + name + \" you are \" + str(age) + \" years old\") ------------------------------- This can be tedious and it isn't that powerful. f-strings help solve this, they allow you to format different variables and functions inside a string. (f stands for format). Here is the same example from before with an f string ------------------------------- age = 22 name = \"Max\" print(f\"hello {name} you are {age} years old\") ------------------------------- This is a lot more readable. f-strings can execute any function. Anything that returns a value (variables just return whatever they're storing) a f-string can do. This allows you to do things like this easily as well: ------------------------------- age = 22 name = \"Max\" print(f\"hello {name} you will be {age + 10} years old in 10 years\") ------------------------------- It goes even further than that though because f-strings have some extra functionality (show in images at the bottom)",

    "post_content_snippet": "One of the best ways to learn quicker is to do projects. Working on projects as you learn (and using them to guide what you learn) is a great way to progress because you: - build a portfolio - make sure you learn meaningful things - and get to practice I recommend working on projects in 90% of cases. The only time you shouldn't be working on some kind of project (even if its just in the background of your learning) is if you don't know enough yet to understand what projects to do or how they work. Here are some great project ideas for different fields that you can do as you learn (and improve as you learn more) that will also help build your portfolio: Data Science - Make a tool to visualize data in an organized nice way. - You can start with just printing dictionaries and list data structures to the terminal and over time improve it with charts and more in depth organization. - This shows that you know how to work with data on your portfolio and can be a great tool for you to use in your future work if you need to create charts easily. Web Development - Make a personal portfolio. - You can start with just python basic stuff as you learn it in the terminal, then learn flask or django to create a website with it. - Then after you finish that you have a hub that 1. shows you know how to make websites, and 2. you can put your future projects on. Automation - Automate project creation for python projects. - Again you can start simple here but over time as you add to it, this can be a tool you use to speed up your work in the future. So you are building an actual useful tool as you learn that works as a portfolio piece and will help you in the future. Web Scraping - For web scraping it's kind of hard to think of a tool that will help you, work as a portfolio piece, and help you learn. - You could make a scraper that pulls job data for jobs you might be interested though and it would fit all three criteria. Outside of that it depends more on what you are doing web scraping for.",

    "post_content_snippet": "One major package for data science and data analysis in Python is pandas. To install it you simply run: pip install pandas This package gives you access to more data structures that allow you to easily work with data: such as DataFrame. I attached a picture of a DataFrame at the bottom. It also provides a lot of tools for reading, cleaning, transforming and analyzing data. Another common tool to use is Jupyter (or google Colab) when working with data. To install it just run: pip install jupyter Then to start a Jupyter environment in your browser run: jupyter lab This gives you access to a notebook environment where you can run cells independently (so you don't have to do large computations multiple times when making small changes). Some common pandas functions include: - pandas.DataFrame: where you can turn dictionaries into a DataFrame to work with. - pandas.read_csv(): where you can turn csv files into a DataFrame to work with. - df.head(): where you an see the first few elements of a DataFrame (df). - df.describe(): where you can see key stats about the DataFrame (count, mean, std, min...). - df\\[key\\]: where you can access a row or a column. - df\\[df\\[key\\] > 0\\]: where you can filter by values larger than a number. - Etc. Here is a link to their documentation that has some very good guides to some of the things you can do. If you guys want I can also work on more resources about this in posts or courses. https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html",

    "post_content_snippet": "LLMs (large language models) are trained algorithms that receive text input and output a predicted humanlike text output. They work the same way autocomplete does at a larger scale. LLM can be broken down as such: - Large - meaning the size of the model (lots of data and parameters). - Language Model - meaning the type of machine learning algorithm (receive and output text). The goal of most machine learning models is to generalize for whatever task you are trying to accomplish. Since LLMs are focused on generating text (very general problem with a lot of applications), they are very general and preform very well at a lot of tasks. This generalization and performance comes at the cost of the size of these models and computational power (which also means cost). This is why better models cost more. These models predict the probability that a token (part of a word) follows the input to the model. This new predicted token is added to the original input, then that new string is input to the model for the next token and so on until the model either finishes or runs out of tokens it can output. Most LLMs use a transformer neural network. You can read a paper on them here for now if you're interested in learning more about them: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 There are a few different types of LLMs: - Pretrained Model - most base models have been trained on large amount of data to predict a missing token (either from inside a sentence or at the end generally). - Instruction-Tuned LLMs - These Pretrained Models are then often further tuned with instruction answer sets of problems. This includes Q&A pairs typically. This is why LLMs are able to take in a question and generate an answer instead of just working like autocomplete where they continue your sentence. - Dialogue-Tuned LLMs - These LLMs can be and usually are trained further with full dialogues of user questions, model answers, follow up question etc. This is where LLMs get the ability to use past questions and answers in their responses.",

One piece of advice I‚Äôd like to share if you're learning Python: try not to rely on AI for code generation at the start. While AI can be helpful later on, using it too early can hinder your learning journey. It might make you dependent on it, and when your project needs sudden changes, you could struggle because you won't have developed the skills to handle it on your own. Keep pushing yourself to solve problems and learn step-by-step. Don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to me if you need any suggestions or advice on how to crack the Python journey!",

This phase was critical in laying a solid foundation for our models, and I shared some key insights with my team: üîπ Prioritize Preprocessing ‚Äì The quality of data preprocessing plays a crucial role in model performance. Ensuring proper handling of missing values, scaling, and encoding significantly impacts results. üîπ Be Cautious with High Accuracy Scores ‚Äì A high accuracy score isn‚Äôt always a good sign! It could indicate overfitting, making the model unreliable on unseen data. To detect overfitting, always validate your model using cross-validation, learning curve and more üîπ RMSE Gap Matters ‚Äì The smaller the gap between training RMSE and test RMSE, the better the model‚Äôs generalization. A large gap could mean the model is overfitting or underfitting. üîπ Model Selection Strategy ‚Äì Choosing a model should be based on both good generalization and accuracy while ensuring it does not overfit excessively. A well-balanced model will perform consistently across different datasets. This phase was both challenging and insightful, as the team demonstrated strong analytical skills and problem-solving abilities.",

With the goal being to write a program to find unique words in a sentence and count them using a set, I: 1.) Created a dictionary to add the words too as well as handle the counting of the word 2.) Then I opened a set to add the tuples from the dictionary into the set 3.) I reversed the order of the key and val to val key to order from highest to lowest for word count 4.) Printed the list but reordered it by word and count Could I have handed this differntly? I originally wrote this for a list rather than a set to handle the ordering of the words so just modified list.update() to set1.add(). Thanks for the feedback on this :)",

Whether it was \"clean as you go\" from McDonald's or \"don't walk around empty-handed\" from when I was a summer laborer on a construction site, these simple maxims have been valuable.

RECAP: In that post, I asked you to count the pairs of different fingers on one hand. Hopefully, you arrived at 10 pairs. Then, I challenged you to determine the number of triples of different fingers, without counting. HERE'S THE SOLUTION: Imagine counting pairs of fingers by folding two fingers at a time. Each time we fold two fingers, three fingers remain unfolded. This means that counting a pair of fingers by folding them is equivalent to counting a triple of fingers by folding the remaining two! So, WITHOUT COUNTING, we immediately know that the number of triples is the same as the number of pairs‚Äî10. WHY DOES THIS MATTER FOR PROGRAMMING? What we just did is an example of reducing one problem to another ‚Äî and that's how programmers think! This is exactly the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) mindset. Instead of reinventing the wheel, programmers define a minimal set of functions and then express every needed computation in terms of those functions. And if you want to take it a level higher, great programmers design functions that create an application-specific language, allowing them to think and code within it.

I think that learning Python will help me achieve both these goals :) Also, dropping in my screenshot for my first assignment. HelloWorld.py",

So I spent like 2 hours already debugging the program and it almost works, but I keep getting this database migration as shown in the image. The guy in tutorial gets almost like a copy of his flask class in there but I get this. I wonder why this is the case. Anyways, what started as interest in how \"flask db init\" and \"flask db upgrade\" works ended up in me getting in the rabbit hole of so much more knowledge.",

I really liked @Islam Benrahla idea for RPG style elements in the platform. In today's meeting (in 6 hours) we will go over this and try to finalize ideas on the first version of the project. I'm excited! If you are able to, please join the meeting this time! Here's the link for the front end I made using AI to get my ideas out a bit: https://v0-core-ui-design-zgiu3t.vercel.app/ Here's an overview of what the project could entail: üîπ1. Player Progression (No More Basic Points, More RPG Feel) Players earn: - XP (Experience Points) ‚Üí Used to level up - Items & Gear ‚Üí Represent their achievements - Gold/Tokens ‚Üí Used to unlock special challenges How it works: - Completing a challenge gives XP + a chance to earn an item - Some challenges grant special one-time rewards (rare items) - Players can \"level up\" to unlock new types of challenges & abilities üîπ 2. Challenge Types & Rewards Challenges should have tiers, each with unique rewards: üìú Standard Challenges - Give XP & basic items (e.g., \"Python Novice‚Äôs Ring\") - Needed for leveling up - Some repeatable, some one-time üèÜ One-Time Legendary Challenges - Special boss fights or difficult problems - Grant rare items, massive XP, and leaderboard recognition - Limited attempts (like a \"raid\" in an RPG) üóùÔ∏è Unlockable Areas / Dungeons - Some parts of the game (advanced topics) are locked - To enter, you must level up or collect key items - Example: You need the \"Loops Master‚Äôs Staff\" to access recursion puzzles üîπ 3. Item System Players get gear & artifacts as rewards: Example Item Rewards: - \"Loop Master's Staff\" (Awarded for completing loop challenges) - \"OOP Wizard‚Äôs Cloak\" (For finishing an OOP milestone) - \"Debugger's Ring\" (For solving debugging problems) - \"Python Grandmaster Medal\" (Leaderboard top reward)",

    "post_content_snippet": "Unpacking in Python lets you assign and manipulate parts of a list, tuple, string, or dictionary in a clean and Pythonic way. Imagine you have a list, and you want to assign the first element (head) to a variable and the rest (tail) to another. A traditional approach would be to manually index. But there are some problems with this: - It can cause errors (shown later). - It is less readable then using unpacking. See the picture for an example. If you want to read more in depth about unpacking, you can view it wherever you would prefer: - In the classroom: link - LinkedIn article: link - Blog post: link Let me know what you guys think.",

Two things that stood out to me that I've got questions on. 1) When I run it as in the video, the text rolls off smoothly, just as I'd expect, but when I run it with its own terminal (either from the windows command prompt or in VSC. It seems to not execute the 'print' commands until after it exits each for loop, and the animation effect doesn't work. Thoughts? 2) Also I'd like to be able to run a sub procedure for the text generation and I could just look it up but thought I would ask here anyway. (may be multiple ways of doing it) Thanks!",

We came up with 2 tangible ideas, but also want to explore other project ideas in different niches as well. Please vote on what project you would like to work on or see, we're going to try to decide on the project before next week so we can start working on planning and breaking it down next week. Here are the projects we discussed: 1. A LLM fine tuned with Python knowledge to work as a resource for developers This project suggested by @Noah Fry would be a LLM that we train with python data and projects to specialize it to basically be like a ChatGPT for Python specific. This would allow people in this community, other developers, and people who want to know more about python to ask specific questions and get more depth and resources in their answers from it. 2. A Online Game to help people learn Python This project suggested by @Patrick Edosoma would be a game that people have to solve problems and go through challenges to learn Python. @Cristian Macovei mentioned this website that is a great online resource to learn git https://learngitbranching.js.org as something similar so you can get an idea of what the project would entail. Kind of like the git one but for Python.",

I made a discord (its just a simple server right now), so if you are one of the people interested in working on the project in any capacity you should join because most of our communication will be on there. https://discord.gg/S5ZfYuwy We also are going to break into a few different teams as we work on it: Front end Back end AI @Waqas Baloch came up with the idea to incorporate a LLM to grade peoples responses.

Here it is for those of you that did not see it before when I made a post about it: https://drumgenai.streamlit.app I made it along with @Noah Fry for a school project last semester. Whenever I get more into teaching AI content I will do a full breakdown, but for now this was the general process: The first thing we did was figure out a way to represent the data. Since drum patterns are sequential, we used midi (drum sequencing) to convert drum hits to binary (1 if a drum plays, 0 if it does not) on a specific note. This also removes the need for things such as temp and velocity. A drum pattern like this: Kick - - - Kick - - - Kick - - - Kick - - Kick - - - - Snare - - - - - - - Snare - - - - HH - HH - HH - HH - HH - HH - HH - HH -.... Can be encoded into: 1000100010001001 0000100000001000 1010101010101010 With each line being a separate list containing the track. We manually converted Wav drum breaks into midi files then wrote a script to convert those midi files into separate binary files for each track of each loop. We made about 200. We then took parts of some of the drum patterns. E.g. the kick from track one, snare from 3, HH from 5 at random and reviewed them to see if they sounded good or not. This was to create more data. We then had around 600 tracks. After this we trained machine learning models to generate the binary patterns for a LSTM model and a Transformer model. We did one other model that we were having some issues deploying the app with. After this we built the streamlit app and deployed it. You can see the code for the app here \"https://github.com/maxmeadowcroft/gen_ai_drum_generator\". Let me know if you have any specific questions. Again, I will go in depth on some of this whenever I get to making AI courses in the future.",

I will also do my best to document and create content around our development process while we work on the projects to help you learn. Here are the breakdowns of the two projects and what the first versions of the projects would contain: ---------------------------------- 1 - Intelligent Dependency Checker for PyPI Packages OVERVIEW Monitors Python dependencies for malicious code, suspicious updates, or known CVEs, leveraging AI to spot unusual patterns. -- FIRST VERSION - Primary Goal: Provide a quick way for developers to see if the Python packages they‚Äôre using (or planning to use) have known security issues or suspicious characteristics. Core Features: - Vulnerability Database Integration: Checks each package against publicly available sources (e.g., PyPAAdvisory Database, Safety DB) to identify known CVEs or reported security flaws. - Metadata Analysis: Gathers basic data (release frequency, maintainer info, etc.) from PyPI to spot unusual patterns (e.g., package rename, rapid versioning). - Risk Score: Generates a simple 1‚Äì10 or low/medium/high ‚Äúrisk score‚Äù so developers can decide whether to proceed with installation or investigate further. ------------------------------------------ 2 - Secrets Detection & Remediation Tool OVERVIEW An AI-based scanner that looks for exposed API keys, credentials, tokens, and other secrets in Python repositories. -- FIRST VERSION - Primary Goal: Detect accidentally committed secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) in a Python codebase or repository and guide developers on how to fix the problem.",

It has been brought to my attention some of the votes appear to be bots or accounts that have joined simply for the sake of voting. In order to ensure fairness let me know what you think would be a good way to count the votes despite this. Here are some of the ideas I have had. If you have any other ides let me know in the comments. I also am working on measures to ensure fair competitions in the future. Some of my ideas for future contests include live voting (where we all join a meeting and users showcase their projects then members vote from within the meeting). (Tiered voting so you can vote for multiple people with multiple point values).",

A re-vote was also highly considered, but poses in itself a lot of challenges that I would rather fix in between this and the next contest. Thank you to everyone who participated. Here are the results and the number of votes (each persons vote counts as whatever their community rank is). ü•á - $100 - @Patrick Edosoma - Osteoporosis knee Classification (27 points) ü•à - $25 - @Haider Aman - Knee Surgery Risk Calculator (18 points) ü•â - $0.25 - @Dahiru Ibrahim - Knee GPT / U-Knee Versity (12 points) I am work to build a voting system that requires everyone to be active in the community (to a certain extent at least) so it's fair as well as figuring out ways to make all future competitions better. I will make a post later this week for the voting of the next competition category. Thank you all for participating if you made a project or just voted üòÅ.

    "post_content_snippet": "When I was in university, I decided to learn C++ on my own. Out of curiosity, I asked a friend why he loved Python so much. Truth be told, I was initially intimidated by the name \"Python\" (it sounded scary!üòÅ). His response, however, changed everything for me. He said Python was easy to learn and understand, extremely versatile, widely used, and most importantly, Python developers were in high demand. That last point about demand struck a chord with me. Without hesitation, I bought a course titled \"100 Days of Python\" and started learning. It was a lot of fun, and as I progressed, I decided to channel my newfound Python skills into data science‚Äîa field I‚Äôve loved. Having studied Mathematics and Chemistry in my diploma program for four years, followed by another four years studying Mathematics in my undergraduate, my passion for statistics was undeniable. At first, I didn‚Äôt know how to pursue becoming a data scientist. So, I went on Udemy and purchased my first-ever course, \"Data Science 360.\" It was tough; I barely understood anything at first. But I kept at it watching, rewatching, and practicing what the instructors were doing. Eventually, I completed the course, with only a basic understanding of what data science meant üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Determined to learn more, I purchased another course by Jose Portilla, and that decision transformed my journey. Jose‚Äôs teaching style was clear and engaging. He explained concepts like model intuition, coefficients, weights, and biases in a way that made everything click for me. My knowledge grew, and I started to truly understand data science. I kept buying his courses, one after another, and he became my invisible mentor. Many nights, I even fell asleep listening to his voice, and to this day, I dream of meeting him in person. However, I realized that self-paced learning wasn‚Äôt enough. I was learning but felt disconnected and unsure of my direction. That‚Äôs when I joined a bootcamp. It was a game-changer. In the bootcamp, I met like-minded individuals who shared the same goals. Together, we built projects, had live sessions, and supported each other. This collaborative environment deepened my love for data science.",

You can control what happens when someone accesses an attribute, sets an attribute, or deletes an attribute. You can do this with these methods: - `__get__(self, instance, owner)`: Defines behavior for attribute access. - `__set__(self, instance, value)`: Defines behavior for attribute assignment. - `__delete__(self, instance)`: Defines behavior for attribute deletion.

(See the first picture). ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Multiline f-strings You can use triple quotation marks to make a multiline f-sting to help you format even better. (Picture 2). ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Number Formatting You can also change the types of numbers or round the decimals of them with f-strings. (Picture 3). ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Percentages Similarly if you have a percent that is not yet formatted you can format it like this. (Picture 4). ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Commas as a thousands separator You can format big numbers by putting commas between the sections to make them easier to read. (Picture 5). ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Alignment and padding You can pad your output with a character, then align what you want to output inside of it. (Picture 6). ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Date Formatting If you use DateTime, you can format how you print out the information. (Picture 7).",

If there aren't categories there, that means that the voting has already finished. üìÅ The way this works (because I know a lot of people were confused last time), is that you program something related to the category in Python. It can be anything. Then in the community we show off everybody's projects in some way, and people vote for which ones they like the most. Then the winners will get the prizes. üèÜ For this month, I'll keep the prizes the same as last time so: ü•á1rst place - $100 ü•à2nd place - $25 ü•â3rd place - $0.25 I'll give you guys more time than last time on the contest this time around, so we'll end it January 15th. üìÖ The voting for the category will close 1 week from now (December 10th) Please comment if you have any questions. I cannot wait to see what you guys program.",

    "post_content_snippet": "Python continues to dominate fields like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data science due to its simplicity and a rich ecosystem of libraries. Tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn make it easier than ever to build complex models, while Pandas and NumPy simplify data manipulation and analysis. Python‚Äôs versatility also extends to deployment, with frameworks like Flask and FastAPI enabling seamless integration of AI models into web applications. Combined with cloud services like AWS and Google Cloud, developers can scale AI solutions effectively. To make the most of Python‚Äôs strengths: - Explore libraries like PyTorch for deep learning and Pandas for data analysis. - Use FastAPI for building lightweight APIs to deploy machine learning models. Python's appeal lies in its balance of accessibility and power. It‚Äôs amazing how a language that‚Äôs so beginner-friendly can also drive cutting-edge innovations in AI and data science. Its thriving community ensures that it will remain a cornerstone of tech for years to come.",

To bypass these, you can use tools like Selenium to automate browsers and run JavaScript, or employ rotating proxies to avoid IP blocking. (Websites with high security can detect what Selenium is doing, so DrissionPage has become popular recently. https://github.com/sarperavci/CloudflareBypassForScraping) Additionally, CAPTCHA-solving services like 2Captcha can help bypass verification challenges. Combining these methods allows you to scrape Cloudflare-protected sites, but it is important to always respect website terms and use ethical scraping practices. I hope this helps you. Thank you.",
